## What is this?

A collection of **Azure SRE Agent subagents** that port the [Azure Optimization Engine (AOE)](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/tree/dev/src/optimization-engine) into the [Azure SRE Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sre-agent/overview) platform.

Instead of 50 Azure resources, 35 PowerShell runbooks, and a SQL database, you get **YAML definitions + markdown knowledge base documents** that an AI agent uses to perform the same infrastructure optimization analysis in real-time.

## Why?

| Dimension | AOE (Current) | SRE Agent Subagents (This Project) |
|---|---|---|
| Data collection | 22 PowerShell runbooks → blob → LA | Agent queries APIs directly |

| Infrastructure | ~50 Azure resources | 3 resources (App Insights, LA, MI) |
| Output | SQL DB + Power BI | Email, Teams, ServiceNow, PagerDuty |
| Intelligence | Static arithmetic (P99, thresholds) | AI-powered pattern analysis |

### Deploy (Recommended — Bicep + PowerShell)

```powershell
# One command deploys Agent + Managed Identity + Log Analytics + App Insights + RBAC
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

## The FitScore

The most valuable piece ported from AOE is the **FitScore** — a 0–5 validation score for VM rightsizing recommendations:

```
Score 5.0 — ✅ Safe to resize (all constraints pass)
Score 4.x — ✅ Likely safe (minor soft constraints)
Score 3.x — ⚠️  Caution (review before proceeding)
Score 2.x — ❌ Risky (significant constraint pressure)
Score 1.x — 🛑 Do NOT resize (hard constraint violation)
```

FitScore validates 7 dimensions: data disk count, NIC count, uncached disk IOPS, uncached disk throughput, CPU utilization, memory utilization, and network throughput.

**New capability beyond AOE:** When FitScore fails, our subagent searches the SKU catalog for alternative sizes that *do* pass validation.

## Acting on Findings

After the agent generates a report, you choose how to remediate:

| Approach | How | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct fix** | Ask the agent: *"Resize vm-oversized-v3 to D2s_v5"* — agent executes via `RunAzCliWriteCommands` | Dev/test, demo environments |
| **Script generation** | Ask: *"Generate the CLI commands to fix all findings"* — agent outputs a reviewable script | Production with manual change control |
| **IaC generation** | Ask: *"Generate Bicep to remediate these findings"* — agent produces IaC you merge via PR | Regulated environments, GitOps workflows |

**Recommended for production:** Use IaC generation with a separate infrastructure repo. The agent scans and reports in this repo; remediation PRs go to your team's infra repo where they follow normal change management (PR review → approval → CI/CD deploy). This keeps "how the agent thinks" separate from "what the agent changes."
